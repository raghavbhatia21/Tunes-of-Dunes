A visit to the Golden City isn't really a visit unless you go on a **Camel Safari in Jaisalmer**. It's the one thing that comes out of the Thar Desert and the whole world gets to know it. This is how you decelerate and really feel the desert. The desert sand has a way of desaturating your mind and making everything seem like it is the same; the desert becomes universal and the earth bigger in variety is what you are left with. But unquestionably it would be a contradiction to say such a thing because each and every one of the dunes here has its own name memory and history. **Desert safaris in Rajasthan** are quite diverse but we must say that camel safaris are the most popular ones. At **Tunes of Dunes** we are of the opinion that a camel ride is not merely a trip but rather a voyage to the core of Rajasthan which shows you the sand dunes and the golden sun from a completely different angle.

## Why an Iconic Camel Safari Jaisalmer is a Must
The camel has been the "Ship of the Desert" and the most prominent means of transport in these barren lands for hundreds of years. When you opt for a **Camel Safari Jaisalmer**, it is akin to moving with the time of history. Rather than the loudness of a 4x4 Jeep, the gentle steps of a camel make it possible for you to experience the desert's quietness and the wind's melody.

**Tunes of Dunes** takes it as their responsibility that every guest is provided with a healthy, well, rested camel and a knowledgeable guide who is very familiar with the desert.

## Sunset, Sunrise, and Starry Nights
The enchantment of a **Camel Safari Jaisalmer** reaches its peak during the "golden hours." A sunset safari is the favorite option by far, as the heavens change into a canvas of bright oranges and dark purples, throwing long shadows over the waves of the **Sam Sand Dunes**. If anyone decides to go for a less noisy start, a sunrise safari will give them a fresh, cool atmosphere and the serene desert landscape waking up.

**Tunes of Dunes** is also conducting overnight expeditions where people can continue their ride late at night and then rest under the stars after having a traditional Rajasthani dinner.

## Preparing for Your Desert Adventure
A small effort in preparation can take your **Camel Safari Jaisalmer** to another level of experience. The wearing of long trousers is advisable in order to prevent chafing during the ride, also, wear comfortable shoes. Protection from the sun is absolutely necessary, so dont forget your wide, brimmed hat, polarized sunglasses, and good sunscreen. Drinking water is very important in the desert heat and so always carry a water bottle with you. Though we, at **Tunes of Dunes**, take care of all the necessary comforts in our guided tours, yet these easy steps will make sure that you are comfortable all along your trek.

## Conclusion
A **camel safari in the Jaisalmer desert** is definitely an experience you will never forget. However, it is not just about the thrill of the ride, it is about the memories you make among the ever, changing dunes. In case you are a traveler who is going solo and looking for tranquility, or a family wanting to have some fun, **Tunes of Dunes** is dedicated to offering you a genuine and consciously managed desert adventure.
