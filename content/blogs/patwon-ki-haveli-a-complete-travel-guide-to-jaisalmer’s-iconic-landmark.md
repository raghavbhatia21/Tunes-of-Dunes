Guman Chand Patwa, a wealthy businessman, and his sons were the people behind the construction of Patwon ki Haveli in the beginning of the nineteenth century. Patwon ki Haveli was set in five separate portions which were meant to be the residences for different members of the family.



This was the reason why the outward appearance of the building was so grand and each of the five parts had an elaborate design to it. The faade of the building is made of yellow sandstone and it is decorated with exquisite sculptures, jharokhas, balconies, and arches revealing the excellent talents of the local craftsmen.



Each part of the structure speaks of the trade, affluence, and Jain mercantile lifestyle. Jain traders were the ones who prospered in the region during those times.
