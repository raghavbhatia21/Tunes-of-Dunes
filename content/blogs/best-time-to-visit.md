**Jaisalmer**, the mythical **"Golden City"**, is a place that charms every one of you with its delightful golden sandstone buildings and the enchanting, boundless **Thar Desert**. A visit here definitely calls for an assortment of factors, especially weather, since deserts are pretty extreme climates. The **Best Time to Visit Jaisalmer** thus becomes a necessity if you want your **Tunes of Dunes** adventure to be both pleasant and unforgettable.

## The Golden Season: Winter (October to March)

The **winter months** are generally considered the **best time to visit Jaisalmer**. The extreme heat gives way to cool and fresh desert air. Day temperatures remain between **20°C and 25°C** which is just right for a walk through the narrow winding lanes of the **Jaisalmer Fort** or take a **desert safari**. **Tunes of Dunes** Winter expeditions are designed to display the desert's magnificence under a bright blue sky.

Visiting in winter definitely has the advantage of making the trip to see the **Desert Festival** in **Jaisalmer**. The colourful festivity that includes **camel races**, **folk music**, and traditional Rajasthani competitions is a great part of the **cultural immersion** to visit Jaisalmer. For anywhere else, **February** would be too cold, but not here. You definitely want to make sure to have some **warm clothes** with you if you're planning to stay at any of our fabulous **desert camps**.

## The Offbeat Experience: Monsoon (July to September)

Jaisalmer is a dry city and gets almost no rain. But still, the monsoon season brings a different charm to the Thar Desert. The humidity does go up, but the landscape changes a bit as green patches appear among the golden sand. Those who are looking for a quiet place and want to spend less can argue that this is the **Best Time to visit Jaisalmer**. The desert is still beautiful, but you will not have to share it with the crowd, and **Tunes of Dunes** has some exclusive monsoon packages if you are a fan of the desert's moody atmosphere.

## The Harsh Reality: Summer (April to June)

Summer in the desert is definitely a test of one's endurance. It can get so hot that the sun is almost impossible to challenge. Temperatures are often recorded above 45 °C, a huge understatement, which renders any sort of outdoor activities out of the question, if not downright suicidal, during the day. In addition, a handful of heritage hotels may provide attractive discounts to lure in the customers, but the scorching heat makes the whole thing self-defeating. Unless you are after the experience of braving the extreme heat or have planned an indoor retreat, we typically recommend that you refrain from coming during these months. At **Tunes of Dunes**, we are fully aware of the risks that nature poses to our guests and also their comfort is always in our mind when planning out a complete desert experience, which we highly recommend during winter.

## Conclusion

Whoever you happen to be, February's festive spirit or December's calm and peaceful charm, you surely cannot go wrong by choosing to travel in the **Best Time to Visit Jaisalmer.** It would be during the winter season is an unarguable fact. The amazing combination of comfortable weather and lively festivals is what really gives you the perfect opportunity to unravel the secrets of the Golden City. Book your trip with **Tunes of Dunes** and get ready to be enchanted by the most beautiful side of Rajasthan.
